Objects are tracked with a 2D array "floorGrid." Each grid square is a unit of 1 across and the bottom left is (0, 0). Player can find its position on the grid by cutting the decimal off of its x and y position 

Plants are harvestable objects
Fungi are unpassable barriers
Fish are trainable pets

Each type of plant and fungus has a letter and most references to them will look like "plantA" or "fungusC." Each has a made up in-game name like "arcrobe" or "condyle" that starts with its assigned letter.
